                    In this project, I conducted a comprehensive vulnerability assessment of a web application, focusing on identifying and exploiting security weaknesses in order to improve the security posture.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    The assessment involved the following key phases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information Gathering: Discovering the structure and exposed interfaces of the web application.</li>
                    <li>Vulnerability Scanning: Automated and manual tools were used to identify vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li>Exploitation: Confirming vulnerabilities by attempting to exploit them.</li>
                    <li>Reporting: Creating a detailed report of the findings, including potential impacts and remediation recommendations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Tools Used:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Burp Suite</li>
                    <li>OWASP ZAP</li>
                    <li>Nmap</li>
                    <li>SQLMap</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key Vulnerabilities Discovered:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>SQL Injection: Discovered vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized access to the database.</li>
                    <li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Identified multiple XSS points that could be exploited to inject malicious scripts.</li>
                    <li>Broken Authentication: Found weaknesses in the login mechanism that allowed bypassing authentication checks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Project Outcome:</h4>
                <p class="lead">
                    After the assessment, the vulnerabilities were reported to the web application owner, who implemented the recommended mitigations. A follow-up scan confirmed that the issues were resolved, improving the applicationâ€™s security.
